   needed to modify the 3' end to add GFP fusion linker (I suppose).  Used sequences from SRA to determine this.



Analysis procedure

1. Download from SRA and convert via sratoolkit

   bash download_fastq_convert.sh

   generates fastq files

2. Map reads with bowtie2

   bash alignment.sh

   generates sam files

3. Concatenate all sequencing tiles

   bash cat_sam_tiles.sh

4. Count mutations 

   python sam2mutations.py LGK_ref.sam
   python sam2mutations.py LGK_sel.sam

5. Remove SRA, fastq, sam, and index* files

6. Remove mutations that have less than 10 observations

   python filter_less_than_10.py 

7. Convert mutations to sequences (gzipped)

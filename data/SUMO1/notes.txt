1. Data is from 

   A framework for exhaustively mapping functional missense variants
   https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20177908

   We want the "Tile-Seq" data, can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP109119

   Getting the reference sequence was challenging because it is not avail from Supp, SRA, their bitbucket site, or anywhere else


2. Download from SRA and convert via sratoolkit

   bash download_fastq_convert.sh

   generates fastq files


3. Generate the reference sequence for Bowtime mapping

   python get_ref_conscensus.py # this reads all the ref files, gets the consensus (which should be WT), and then aligns all the reads with a close reference from NCBI

   I then maunally asselbled (took best NTs, this was pretty clear) from the output of above.  This work is in: manually_assemble_conscensus.txt


4. Map reads with bowtie2

   bash alignment.sh

   generates sam files


5. Concatenate sam files

   bash cat_sam_tiles.sh


6. Count mutations 

   python sam2mutations.py SUMO1_ref.sam
   python sam2mutations.py SUMO1_sel.sam


7. Remove SRA, fastq, sam, and index* files


8. Remove mutations that have less than 10 observations

   python filter_less_than_10.py

9. Convert mutations to sequences (gzipped)
